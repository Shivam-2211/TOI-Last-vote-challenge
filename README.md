# TOI-Last-vote-challenge
A solution for the problem statement - Many Indians are always on the move for work or education. Many things like the bank accounts and mobile numbers automatically travel with us. But our right to votes is tied to the place where it’s registered in. An individual must be physically present where they are registered on polling day to be allowed to vote. Because of this a lot of individuals are not able to vote and this results in declining the voting percentage. It needs to be changed. It should be possible for every Indian to vote irrespective of where he or she may be temporarily located. The objective of this challenge is to design a strong and secure technological solution or prototype that will allow electors to vote without having to go to the designated polling station of their respective constituencies.
## OUR SOLUTION:
•	A Web Application System Integrated with blockchain- a special property called immutability protects system.

•	Voter needs to enter his/her credentials in order to vote.

•	All data is then encrypted and stored as a transaction.

•	This transaction is then broadcasted to every node in network, which in turn is then verified.

•	If network approves transaction, it is stored in a block and added to chain, once a block is added into chain, it stays there forever and can’t be updated.

•	People living in the city where there voting belongs can go & vote on the poll stations to submit their vote or if they are not in city they can vote even from their current location, they just need to put proper credentials like their Aadhar card QR & Real time face they can vote from anywhere around the globe. 

•	We are using Hyper Fabric Ledger Blockchain which is a type of Blockchain which askes the sender for authentication. So, by using this nobody can cast a fake vote without users’ permission.
